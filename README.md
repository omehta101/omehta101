Sharing some of my projects here, be that trading comps, projects, or random notebooks I made for club meetings. Hope to use this as educational for anybody who wants to learn something! Also, some other random facts about me:

- Avid gym goer 
- I medidate daily
- I am super interested in anatomy, neuroscience, and psychology; particularly the nervous system's interactions w/ the other bodily systems and how these impact our daily lives.
- I recently started boxing
- I'm an early riser
- I am a big health fanatic so I track my sleep, caloric intake, sauna and cold plunge exposure

I believe all of this stuff has helped me become who I am today & I hope to share that with whoever I can.
