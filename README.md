## Om Mehta

I'm Om ‚Äî studying Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago. I hold a Bachelor's in Quantitative Finance from Stevens Institute of Technology.

This GitHub is a collection of projects I've worked on: trading competitions, research notebooks, and side projects ‚Äî many of which were built for club meetings, coursework, or just curiosity. My goal is to make these resources educational and insightful for anyone interested in quantitative trading, global macro, and data science.
